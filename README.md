# Zindi - Layer.ai Air Quality Prediction Challenge
Hello, this is my attempt to [this](https://zindi.africa/competitions/layerai-air-quality-prediction-challenge) competition hosted by [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/).

I have used the following things here:

* cleaning the dataset
* training model
* generating submission

This strategy did not work well on the leadrborad but the take away here is that I learned a completely new technology.

## Installation
First create a new python virtual environment, activate that virtual environment and install the required packages

> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run
You can run the `main.py` file, this will do the following things:

> python main.py

1. read and clean the dataset [prepare_dataset.py]
2. train ML model, for this make sure to have a look at `model_configuration.json`, this step will also save all the models, best model, preprocessing object, a `score.json` file [make sure to have a look at `configuration.py` file.]
3. generate submission file for each model and an ensembled submission file, the weights for the ensembled submission file is calculated from the `score.json` file.
